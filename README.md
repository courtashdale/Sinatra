# 🎸 Sinatra

Sinatra is a full-stack web application for sharing Spotify listening habits. The app lets users sign in with Spotify, analyze playlists and genres, and display a public profile accessible from a unique URL. It provides a FastAPI backend with MongoDB storage and a React frontend build with Vite. 

## 🗺️ Project Structure

The project is a monorepo containing two main parts:

- **/frontend**: A React-based single-page application that serves as the user interface.
- **/backend**: A Python-based API that handles logic, storage, and communication with the Spotify API.

## 🧰 Core Technologies

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast build tool for web development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.

### Backend
- **Python**: The primary language for the backend.
- **FastAPI**: A high-performance web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for data storage.
- **Spotipy**: A Python library for interacting with the Spotify Web API.

## 🏎️ Getting Started
